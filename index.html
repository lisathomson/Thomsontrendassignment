	<b>But before we get started, let's answer a few basic questions...</b>

	<h4>What is a refugee?</h4>
	<p> According to the Department of Homeland Security a refugee is "a person who has fled his or her country of origin because of past persection or a feat of future persecution based upon race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group."</p>

		<h4>How many many refugees does the U.S. admit each year?</h4>
			<p>This varies, but each year the President submits a report to the Congress recommending how many refugees should be admitted. In 2015 the ceiling was 70,000. The ceiling for 2016 is 85,000.</p>

			<p>In addition to the recommended ceiling for all refugees, the President also recommends regional ceilings. The proposed ceiling for refugees from Africa in 2016 was 25,000.</p>

			<p><b>Quick Context:</b></p>

			<p>In 2003 Ethiopia was suffering from a drought which resulted in a famine that impacted over 15 million people. The government implemented a voluntary resettlement initiative for those most impacted. By 2004 an estimated 300,000 people had been relocated. In 2003 UN peacekeepers were deployed to the border of Eritrea, the details of which were still under negotiation following a two year border war between the two counties.</p>

			<p> In 2012, Fran&#231;ois Boziz&#233; was elected president of the Central African Republic. The result of the election was contested by the opposition, but ultimately held no sway. By 2011, it is estimated that the Lord's Resistance Army had kidnaped over 3,000 people. 

				<p> In 2007, several hundered people were killed after fighting broke out over the previous year's contested presidential election in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
